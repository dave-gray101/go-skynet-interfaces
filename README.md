# DEPRECIATED
Use [go-skynet/go-common](https://github.com/go-skynet/go-common) instead. This was just a preliminary draft from before I migrated this to the go-skynet org.


## Go-Skynet Common Interfaces and Structures
This package is intended to be consumed by the go-* series of local AI backends used by the go-skynet project.

This package exists to contain shared interfaces and structures that are common to all backends. Code specific to actually instantiating or leveraging these types likely belongs in a more specific project.
